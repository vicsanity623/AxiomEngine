## ◈ The Vision: Clarity Over Hallucination

Axiom is a **Grounding Engine** designed for a world in cognitive crisis. We are drowning in engagement-optimized misinformation and "Black Box" AI hallucinations.

**Axiom is strictly Anti-AI.** We reject the probabilistic "guessing" of Transformers and Large Language Models. Instead, Axiom builds a **Lexical Mesh**—a deterministic, symbolic map of language and facts gathered directly from verified RSS streams. It is an autonomous public utility for truth, immune to corporate or political manipulation.

> *"Truth is not a probability. Axiom is the digital commonwealth where reality is preserved to provide peace of mind."*

## ◈ Architecture: The Living Mesh

Every Axiom node operates as a self-sustaining organism, executing a continuous five-phase cycle:

| Phase | Engine | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01: Discovery** | **Zeitgeist** | Identifies trending topics via public RSS without tracking APIs. |
| **02: Extraction**| **Pathfinder**| Surgically pulls content using a fortified, bot-resistant scraper. |
| **03: Verification**| **The Crucible**| Uses Analytical NLP to extract facts while discarding opinions. |
| **04: Linking** | **Synthesizer**| Builds a Knowledge Graph by identifying shared entities. |
| **05: Reflection** | **Lexical Mesh**| Shreds facts into semantic synapses to build a "Linguistic Brain." |

## ◈ Unique Technological Pillars

### 🧠 The Lexical Mesh (The Glass Box)
Unlike LLMs that use trillions of hidden weights, Axiom learns language through **Linguistic Atoms** and **Neural Synapses** stored in an open SQL ledger. You can query exactly *why* Axiom associates two concepts. **Zero GPU required.**

### 🕵️ Radical Anonymity
Queries are routed through a private P2P mesh. Using the built-in **Tailscale Funnel** integration, you can securely query your node from your mobile device anywhere in the world.

### 🧬 The Corroboration Rule
A fact is never trusted on first sight. It remains `uncorroborated` until an independent source makes the same claim. Direct contradictions are flagged as `disputed`.

## ◈ Quick Start

### 1. Installation (Source)
```bash
# Clone and enter
git clone https://github.com/vicsanity623/AxiomEngine.git
cd AxiomEngine

# Install hardened dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### 2. Launching the Node
```bash
# Start the engine and join the Genesis Network
python node.py
```

### 3. Build Portable Binary (.dmg / .exe)
Axiom includes a hardened build system for **Python 3.13** that generates a professional installer with a "Drag to Applications" shortcut.
```bash
python build_standalone.py
```

## ◈ Inspection & Visualization

Axiom provides high-fidelity tools to watch the network think in real-time.

*   **Audit the Ledger & Brain:**
    ```bash
    python view_ledger.py --stats  # General Health
    python view_ledger.py --brain  # Top Neural Synapses
    ```

*   **Visualize the Constellation:**
    ```bash
    python visualize_graph.py          # Fact-to-Fact Knowledge Graph
    python visualize_graph.py --brain  # Lexical Mesh (Linguistic Brain)
    ```

## ◈ Roadmap

- [x] **V1: Genesis** - Core P2P sync and RSS discovery.
- [x] **V2: The Crucible** - Analytical fact extraction and subjectivity filters.
- [x] **V3: Synthesizer** - Weighted Knowledge Graph linking.
- [x] **V3.2: Lexical Mesh** - Non-LLM linguistic brain and "Reflection" idle cycles.
- [x] **V4: Universal Terminal** - Mobile-ready Web UI served directly from the node.
- [ ] **V5: DAO Governance** - Reputation-weighted protocol voting.
